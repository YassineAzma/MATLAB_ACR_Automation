# MATLAB ACR Automation
Scripts for automation of key ACR tests (added functionality for SNR and MTF)

In the current form of the script, all functions can be run readily from the ACR_Main.m script, which also contains additional options that can be customised as needed.

If anything is not clear please leave a message or submit an issue, as appropriate.
